heroquest-cpp
=============

A first-person action-adventure game based on the classic HeroQuest board game
from Milton Bradley and the Games Workshop, developed using C++ and OpenGL by
David C. Drake (http://davidcdrake.com) with initial assistance from Dr. Barton
Stander (http://cit.dixie.edu/faculty/stander.php).

Still in early stages of development.
